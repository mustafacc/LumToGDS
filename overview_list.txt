GDS export library for Lumerical

- python based interface
- loadable LSF version (with default wizard)
- bonus: pyopenGL based 3D viewer for sanity check
- klayout library for viewing?


if lumerical library doesn't work with newest klayout: 
- create manually extraction by pulling lumerical geometry files

further considerations:
-how do round 3D shapes work for extraction?

limitations:
Not compatible with nested geometry objects. Please flatten the Object hierarchy.
Not compatible with objects with same name. Please make sure names are unique
